## Description
​Cup Of Sugar is a hyperlocal neighborhood experience that allows users to promote a friendly environment and share free items within their community. Our application allows the user to browse through a list of free items posted by their neighbors & get the items they like as long as those items are available. The users can also create their own posts of free items within their neighborhood.

## Usage
​Users can register for an account with their name, email and password. Currently the app supports the Seattle area only. Once registered or once the user logs in, they will see a list of what neighbors have posted to give away. If a user wants an item they can click the "Get" button and will be shown the post owners' email to contact for pick up. The user can click on the top right + to create a post with a item name, description and photo. Users can see all the posts they have created in the My Posts tab and can delete if a post if they have changed their mind about giving away the item.
